# ***0X00. AIRBNB CLONE - THE CONSOLE***

- An object-oriented program typically includes the ability to:
create a new object (such as a User or a Place),
retrieve an object from a file, database, or other source, 
perform operations on objects (such as counting or 
computing statistics), update the attributes of an object, 
and destroy an object when it is no longer needed.
These actions form the fundamental building blocks of 
object-oriented programming and allow developers to effectively
model real-world objects and relationships within their code.

## **Requirements**

## **Python Scripts**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled 
on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation 
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation 
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) 
should have a documentation (python3 -c 
'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' 
and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real 
sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, 
class or method (the length of it will be verified)
		
## **Python Unit Tests**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
- e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: 
tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: 
tests/test_models/test_user.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: 
python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command:
python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your modules should have a documentation 
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class)
should have a documentation (python3 -c
'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' 
nd python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases,
so that you don’t miss any edge case
